// API: Application Programming Interface

// Contract provided by one software to another software
// It usually consists of a structured request and structured response


// A set of function and procedures that provide access to the data
// of an operating system, application and others

// Synchronous
let post = loadPostSync();

// Wait till the post fetch
// Do something with post
// Do the next thing()

// Async call
// Use call back function: when we pass one function as a parameter to another function
// loadPostAsync(function(){
//...Wait till the post fetch
//...Do something with post
//...Do the next thing()
// })

// Most of the Async code that you are going to work with are the part of libraries

// 1. XMLHttpRequest and fetch
// 2. callback functions
// 3. Promises
// 4. Async/Await

// AJAX: Async JavaScript and XML
// it is a set of web technologies
// send and receive data asynchronously
// Does not interfer with the current page loading
// JSON has replaced XML in most cases now a days
// no page reload and its very interactive
// XMLHttpRequest: XHR Object
